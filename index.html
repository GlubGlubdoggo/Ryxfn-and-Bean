Harper did fine feeding Bean because she dropped the worm into the water instead of submerging the tweezers.  I should have done that.  Ryxfn has almost finished his dinner, but he is dumb enough to be swimming in circles on the outside of the tupberware, so he doesn't try to get the bloodworms that were scattered to the middle when he went absolutely insane.</p><p><a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMnqtos0JeXA0tpaZiUWcKrP6USSuYCk4LSgBJs_ezus85RcuUkFlfP-0gU7gI9OA">How are the axolotls doing?
