      <h1>Ryxfn and Bean</h1>
      <br />
     <p>Ryxfn is going a bit psycho because the first time I fed it it got traumatized by the tweezers I used to give it bloodworms.  Harper did fine feeding Bean because she dropped the worm into the water instead of submerging the tweezers.  I should have done that.  Ryxfn has almost finished its dinner, but it is dumb enough to be swimming in circles on the outside of the tupperware, so it doesn't try to get the bloodworms that were scattered to the middle when it went absolutely insane.</p>
